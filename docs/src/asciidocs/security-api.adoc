[#share-object]
== Share objects with another user

To programmatically share ThoughtSpot objects with another user or user group, use the `/tspublic/v1/security/share` API. 

When you share an object like a pinboard or visualization, a notification with a live link is sent to the user. When the users access this object, they can view the last saved version of the object.

|Form Parameter|Data Type|Description
|`type`|string a|Type of metadata object. Specify one of the following values as a metadata object type:

* `QUESTION_ANSWER_BOOK` to share search answers.
* `PINBOARD_ANSWER_BOOK` to share pinboards.
* `LOGICAL_COLUMN` to share a column of any data object such as tables, worksheets, or views.
* `LOGICAL_TABLE` to share a data object such as a table, worksheet, or view.
|`id`|string|A JSON array of the GUIDs of the objects to be shared.
|`permission`|string a|A string with the GUIDs of the user or user group, and the type of access privilege.

* The format of the permission string is `{"permissions":{"<GUID of the user or user group>":{"shareMode":"<type-of-access>"}}}`.
* You can provide `READ_ONLY` or `FULL` access to the objects. With `READ_ONLY` access, the user or user group can view the shared object, whereas `FULL` access enables users to modify the object. 

For example, to provide read-only access to a user with a GUID of `7a9a6715-e154-431b-baaf-7b58246c13dd`, specify the string as `{"permissions":{"7a9a6715-e154-431b-baaf-7b58246c13dd":{"shareMode":"READ_ONLY"}}}`

The following example shows how to set the permission string to provide read-only access to multiple users:

`{"permissions": {"e7040a64-7ff1-4ab9-a1b0-f1acac596866": {"shareMode": "READ_ONLY"}, "f7b8f511-317c-485d-8131-26cf084ef47b": {"shareMode": "READ_ONLY"}}}`

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can set the `shareMode` in the permission string to `NO_ACCESS` to remove a user or user group's access to a shared object. For example, if you send a POST request with the permission string as  `{"permissions":{"7a9a6715-e154-431b-baaf-7b58246c13dd":{"shareMode":"NO_ACCESS"}}}`, the user with a GUID of `7a9a6715-e154-431b-baaf-7b58246c13dd` cannot access the shared object.
====

|`emailshares`|string|The email address of the user accounts with whom you want to share the objects. 
|`notify` __Optional__|boolean|When set to `true`, a notification is sent to the users after an object is shared.
|`message` __Optional__|string|The message text to send in the notification email.
|`useCustomEmbedUrls`|boolean|When set to `true`, ThoughtSpot sends a link with the host application context to allow users to access the shared object from their ThoughtSpot embedded instance.
