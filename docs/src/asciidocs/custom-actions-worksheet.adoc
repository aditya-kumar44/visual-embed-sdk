:page-description: Add custom actions to worksheets

ThoughtSpot supports adding custom actions to the visualizations built from worksheets. The custom actions created in the Developer portal appear on a worksheet page, so that you can add these actions to all the visualizations generated using that worksheet. This feature allows ThoughtSpot application users to determine and control the position of a custom action on visualizations generated from a specific worksheet. 

Any user with edit privileges can assign a custom action to visualizations built from a worksheet. 

== Before you begin
* Make sure your application instance has __local__ custom actions. If you have the Developer privilege, you can create custom actions in the Developer portal. 
* Make sure you have edit permissions to modify the worksheet.
* Verify if the link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[new Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster. 

== Associate a custom action to a worksheet

To add a custom action to a worksheet:

. Go to *Data* > *Data Objects* > *Worksheets*.
. Click the worksheet that you want to modify.
. Click the *Custom actions* tab.
+
A list of __Global__ actions is displayed. 

+
[NOTE]
====
The __global__ custom actions appear on all visualizations by default. To add a specific action locally to a worksheet, the __local__ custom actions must be created in the Developer portal.
====

. Click *Add action*.
. Select the custom action that you want to add.
. To specify the position of the action, select one of the following options:
* *Primary*
+
Sets the custom action as a primary menu action.
+
[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot allows only one primary action on a visualization page. If visualizations generated from the worksheet already have a primary action, the new configuration overrides this setting.

If a visualization built from this worksheet already has a primary action added locally at the visualization level, ThoughtSpot will retain this configuration and does not apply the primary action added at the worksheet level.  
====

* *Menu*
+
Adds the custom action to the  **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu].

* *Context menu*
+
Adds the custom action as a menu item in the contextual menu. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set from a visualization, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu. Users can access this action in the contextual menu by right-clicking on a visualization.

+
[NOTE]
====
The ThoughtSpot Developer portal allows developers to set a custom action to appear only in the contextual menu. If the *Only allow in context menu* setting is enabled for a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify the position of this action on visualization pages.
====

+ 
. Preview  the position of the custom action.

. Click *Save*.
+
The custom action is added to the visualization page. 

== Verify the custom action placement

. To view the action you just added, click *Home*.
. Set your worksheet as the data source, specify search tokens, and click search.
+
. Verify if the action is added to the visualization page. 

+
When you save this visualization in search answers or pin it to a pinboard, all users who can access the visualization can use this action.
