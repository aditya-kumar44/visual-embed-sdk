:page-description: Overview of custom actions

ThoughtSpot allows developers to insert buttons and menu items into ThoughtSpotâ€™s UI, which can invoke a specific URL or a callback in their parent application and pass the data from the associated chart or table to these APIs. This allows users to take immediate action on the insights they find in ThoughtSpot.  

Developers can create custom actions in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal. Any application user with edit privileges can add these custom actions to a visualization as a primary button or menu item.  

== Custom actions in the Developer portal

ThoughtSpot users with developer privileges can access the *Custom actions* page by clicking *Develop*  > *Customizations* > *Actions*. The *Custom actions* page includes the following features:

Create action::
The *Create action* button allows you to create a custom action  xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[to send data to a URL] or xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[trigger a callback to the parent application]. Your application users can access these custom actions by clicking the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[the Custom actions icon] on a visualization page.

* Global actions
+
The ThoughtSpot Developer portal allows you to add a custom action to all visualizations. If you want to create a custom action that will appear on all charts and tables, you can create a __global__ action. For example, if you want to create a custom action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add it globally to all visualizations. To add a custom action to all visualizations, you must enable the *Automatically add as global action to all visualizations* checkbox when you create a custom action in the Developer portal.

* Local actions
+
You may want to add a custom action to only a specific visualization. To do this, you can set a custom action as a __local__ action when you create a custom action in the Developer portal. If you do not select *Automatically add as global action to all visualizations* checkbox in the custom action creation page, ThoughtSpot automatically designates it as __local__ action. Any user with edit privileges can add this action to a visualization or to all visualizations generated from a specific worksheet. 
 
Overview::

The *Overview* tab shows the possible locations of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. You can add a custom action as a primary menu, or as a menu item in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu. You can also add the custom action to the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on a visualization in the *Answers* or *Pinboards page*. 

+
By default, ThoughtSpot adds all custom actions to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set obtained from a visualization, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu. You can configure a custom action to appear only in the context menu when you create a custom action in the Developer portal. If you want to change the position of an existing custom action, click the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[custom action icon] on a visualization page, and edit the custom action. 

My actions::
The *My actions* tab lists the custom actions that are available on your ThoughtSpot instance. This page also allows you to edit or delete a custom action configured on your instance.
