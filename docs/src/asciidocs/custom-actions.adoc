[#callback]
== Configure a callback custom action

ThoughtSpot allows you to programmatically set up a callback function from the parent application which triggers on the click of a custom action. For example, if you want to push insights from ThoughtSpot into your app or trigger an event to an external application, you can add a custom action in Thoughtspot and set up a callback in the parent application. When the user clicks this action on the *Answers* or *Pinboards* page, it initiates a callback to the parent application.

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Actions*.
. Click *Create action*.
. Add a label for the custom action.
. Select the *Callback* option.
. Add an ID for the callback function.

+
This ID is used as a reference for the custom action in the Visual Embed SDK. You can use this ID to register a callback event, disable or hide the custom action on a ThoughtSpot application page.

* *Primary*
+
Sets the custom action as a primary button.
* *Menu*
